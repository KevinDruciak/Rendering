#### Summary: {#summary-}

I unfortunately only had time to implement the basic features for this
assignment. Ideally, I would have liked to implement acceleration and
Phong shading. Gouraud shading leaves a lot to be desired. Although I am
able to render different shapes rather nicely, the lack of nicer aspects
of the ray tracer leaves a lot of the images looking rather flat.

#### Implemented Features: {#implemented-features-}

-   all lights
-   all camera operations
-   all shapes
-   affine transformations
-   textures for sphere, triangle, box, torus
-   interactable objects
-   scene ray tracing

#### Unimplemented Features: {#unimplemented-features-}

-   anti-aliasing
-   buffer object rendering
-   glsl lighting
-   transparency, reflections, shadows, robotic arm

#### Modifications to original code base: {#modifications-to-original-code-base-}

-   box.h
    -   pre-compute texture, index, vertex, and normal coordinates
-   light.h + child classes
    -   added virtual method "drawOpenGLoff" to draw ambient lighting
        when lights are turned off
-   scene.cpp
    -   modified "Scene::drawOpenGL" to draw off/on lights
-   scene.h
    -   added "lightsOn" field to keep track of whether lights are
        on/off
-   scene.todo.cpp
    -   modified "getColor" header to draw lights
-   shape.h + child classes
    -   added virtual method "implemented" to track if a shape is able
        to be raytraced (it has an intersect implementation)
-   window.cpp + window.h
    -   declare static variable lightsON to track light status
    -   declare static variable SceneName to track the name of the scene
        .ray file
    -   Window::MouseFunction
        -   I implemented the interactable object functionality here. I
            first get a ray from the camera and intersect the scene. I
            check if the object I intersect with has a material with a
            string identifier such as "button" or door. For the button,
            I simply invert the global light tracking variable which in
            turn turns off the lights. Opening and closing the door was
            a bit trickier than I had expected so I opted for the na√Øve
            solution. If my ray intersects with the door, I first check
            the name of the current scene ray file. I then create a new
            scene from a brand new ray file with the door opened/closed
            and render it. Naturally, this is a pretty slow function,
            but it works for now.

#### Ray::ShapeList::drawOpenGL {#ray-shapelist-drawopengl}

-   calls "drawOpenGL" for all shapes in the list

#### Ray::TriangleList::drawOpenGL {#ray-trianglelist-drawopengl}

-   calls "drawOpenGL" on the shapelist and sets material

#### Ray::Material::drawOpenGL {#ray-material-drawopengl}

-   calls "initOpenGL" for texture. I have to generate a new texture on
    every draw call. I'm sure there's a better way to do this. I also
    check the global variable "Window::lightsON" when generating the
    emissive property in order to simulating a light turning on and off.

#### Ray::Light::drawOpenGL/drawOpenGLoff {#ray-light-drawopengl-drawopengloff}

-   similar to assignment 2 for "drawOpenGL". In "drawOpenGLoff" I
    simulate the light being off by setting all of its properties to 0
    except for ambient.

#### Ray::AffineShape::drawOpenGL {#ray-affineshape-drawopengl}

-   I couldn't find a way to pass the type Matrix4D from "getMatrix"
    into the "glMultMatrixf" call so I had to copy it into an array

#### Ray::Triangle::drawOpenGL {#ray-triangle-drawopengl}

-   used Plane for normals, and vertices for texture/position

#### Ray::Texture::initOpenGL {#ray-texture-initopengl}

-   simply texture init

#### Ray::Box::drawOpenGL {#ray-box-drawopengl}

-   I first precompute the textures/indices/normals/vertices in the
    "initOpenGL" method and iterate iterate over the faces of the box,
    drawing them with GL\_QUADS.

#### Ray::Cylinder::drawOpenGL {#ray-cylinder-drawopengl}

-   draw body with parametric equations for a cylinder using
    TRIANGLE\_STRIP, then endcaps using GL\_TRIANGLE\_FAN

![1](kdrucia1_HTML/cylinder.bmp)

#### Ray::Cone::drawOpenGL {#ray-cone-drawopengl}

-   I figured that the best way to draw a roof for my room scene was to
    use an OpenGLTessellationComplexity of 4 (which is a rectangular
    pyramid) so I check if the material that I am rendering a roof first
    and set the OpenGLTessellationComplexity accordingly. The cone
    itself is a GL\_TRIANGLE\_FAN with the first vertex as the peak. The
    base is a GL\_TRIANGLE\_FAN circle.

#### Ray::Torus::drawOpenGL {#ray-torus-drawopengl}

-   The torus vertices were generated from a torus's parametric
    equations. I was having trouble finding normals to the torus and
    eventually consulted the following resource:
    [http://www.cosinekitty.com/raytrace/chapter13\_torus.html](http://www.cosinekitty.com/raytrace/chapter13_torus.html).

![3](kdrucia1_HTML/torus.bmp)

Fun fact: I couldn't find a texture that mapped properly onto the torus,
so I made my own donut texture in microsoft paint!

#### Ray::Sphere::drawOpenGL {#ray-sphere-drawopengl}

-   Parametric equations for vertices. I render four vertices at a time
    in order to be able to create tex coordinates for GL\_QUAD\_STRIP.

Here is the OpenGL rendering version of my assignment 2 art submission.
It is compared to the ray traced version below.

Here, we can see, in order, closed door, open door, lights on, lights
off, and the flashlight.

The first image is the OpenGL rendering of david.ray. The second is the
ray-traced scene from the same perspective of the current OpenGL
context.

#### Art Submission: {#art-submission-}

I submit this image and its ray file, "kdrucia1.art.3.ray" as my art
submission.
